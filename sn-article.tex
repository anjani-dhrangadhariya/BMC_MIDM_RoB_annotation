%% Background %%
\section{Background and Significance}
\label{sec:background}
%
Systematic reviews (SRs) synthesized using randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are the highest quality of evidence in the evidence pyramid.
SRs aid medical professionals make educated decisions about an individual's health and help governments enact informed health policies.
An RCT is a scientific experiment aiming to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention on particular patient outcomes.
In these trials, patients are randomly divided and allocated to either an active intervention group or a comparator group, and the impact of intervention compared to the comparator is measured in a controlled setting~\cite{sibbald1998understanding}.
Theoretically, RCTs are less susceptible to biases given the randomized study design but are still prone to unavoidable flaws in the trial's design, conduction, or reporting.
Biased clinical trials make medical practitioners systematically overestimate or underestimate the intervention effect on patient outcomes, leading to harmful health practices and policies~\cite{kjaergard1999randomized,naci2019design}.
Thus, Reviewers conducting SRs must thoroughly screen RCTs for biases before inclusion in writing SRs.


The biases in RCTs cannot be measured, but an RCT can be assessed for biases to minimize the overall risk and judge its quality.
Various terms are used for bias assessment, like validity or quality assessment, but in this study, we refer to bias assessment as risk-of-bias (RoB) assessment.
There are several tools to assess RoB, including the Cochrane Collaborations RoB Tool, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) RoB scale, revised Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool, AMSTAR/AMSTAR 2, EPOC RoB Tool and several other independent checklists~\cite{higgins2011cochrane,elkins2013growth,sterne2019rob,shea2017amstar,farrah2019risk}.
These tools are structured as a series of questions aiming to elicit factual information from the RCTs, which could then be used for RoB assessment.
These tools are a series of questions aiming to elicit factual information from the RCTs, which can then be used to assess their quality.
Manual quality assessment requires the reviewers to go through full-text RCTs and manually inspect every question from the chosen bias assessment tool.
The process takes about 3-10 months per person per SR and requires a high degree of methodological expertise on the reviewer's part.
Moreover, RoB assessment is a part of writing systematic reviews, which is highly resource-heavy, taking about six months to several years to complete~\cite{tsertsvadze2015conduct, khangura2012evidence}.
review~\cite{higgins2019cochrane}.
The pace at which RCTs are published makes RoB assessment a lengthy process.
%~\footnote{\url{https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=randomized\%20controlled\%20trial&filter=pubt.randomizedcontrolledtrial}

Machine learning (ML) can help accelerate the assessment process by directly pointing the reviewers to the parts of the RCT text relevant to identifying bias, leading to quickly judging the trial quality.
Marshall \textit{et al.}~\cite{marshall2015automating} attempted automation of RoB assessment using distant supervision approach supported by proprietary data from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR). 
They formulated the trial quality assessment as binary classification into \textit{low-risk} and \textit{unclear-risk/high-risk} quality attributes for each risk domain.
The study was supported by the manually-entered data from CDSR, which is behind a paywall and automates based on Cochrane's RoB 1.0 guidelines and not RoB 2.0~\cite{higgins2011cochrane}.
Millard \textit{et al.}~\cite{millard2016machine} attempted automating RoB assessment using supervised machine learning trained on proprietary data as well.
The question, however, remains of the unavailability of a publicly-available RoB annotated corpus that hinders community efforts for automation. 
Wang \textit{et al.} recently released three RoB annotated datasets, but for preclinical animal studies with RoB assessments pertaining to animals~\cite{wang2022risk}.
Manual RoB assessment is a complex, expert-led task laden with the expert's subjective judgements.
Systematically translating this manual process for developing an RoB annotated corpus requires a carefully designed annotation scheme and detailed annotation guidelines.
Recently Dhrangadhariya \textit{et al.} worked on a pilot study to test whether the currently available RoB 2.0 guidelines could be utilized as guidelines to manually annotate a corpus of randomized controlled trials with RoB using a multi-level annotation scheme adapted from the same guidelines.
They neither provide any annotation guidelines and their dataset is rather small with only 10 annotated RCTs.
Our objective was to develop clear cut annotation guidelines to annotate RCTs with risk-of-bias categories corresponding to the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials (RoB 2)~\cite{sterne2019rob}.



Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance on unseen tasks when only the task instructions are provided.
However, till date, no one has evaluated their performance on the cognitively complex task of identifying risk of bias text descriptions from RCTs and providing their risk judgments based on text.
Our contributions with this paper are five-fold. 
1) We develop comprehensive annotation guidelines for annotating RCTs with risk of bias description.
2) We model these annotation guidelines in form of visual placards for ease of annotation and understanding. These placards could be used as visual RoB assessment guidelines by the trainee RoB assessors.
3) We fine-grained annotate a corpus of 60 full-text randomized controlled trials with more than 20 risk of bias signalling questions which could be used to train machine learning models or even LLMs and could be used as a validation benchmark.
4) We evaluate the performance of LLMs to automatically identify the answers to these signalling questions using prompt generation.
5) We make the annotation guidelines, the dataset and LLM prompts openly-available for the scientific community.

The birds-eye view of our approach is shown in the Figure.

\subsection{Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool}
\label{cochrane}
%
The Cochrane's RoB tool is the most frequently used to assess RCT quality, but a recently revised Cochrane RoB 2.0 offers significant differences in comparison to the original tool~\cite{ma2020methodological}.

The signalling questions are broadly factual but leave room for subjective judgements and aim to facilitate judgements about the risk of bias.

\subsection{Annotation}
\label{annotation}
%
Tagtog~\footnote{\url{https://www.tagtog.net/}}, a commercial text annotation web application, that allows for annotating PDF (Portable Document Format) documents, was used for pilot annotation.
We had to stop using tagtog for certain reasons and switched to the PAWLS annotation tool, which allows users to annotate PDFs for free.
We chose to annotate PDFs rather than plain text because RCT PDFs have a visual format (maintains the structure of sections and subsections, tables, and figures) that makes the annotation task quicker for the annotators and increases annotation quality.
Tagtog allows customized annotation schemes at entity and document levels and has functionality for parsing PDF documents to plain HTML for annotation extraction, allowing for easy quality control for the annotations.
Tagtog has an internal IAA (inter-annotator agreement) scoring scheme and a visual display to report the agreement.
This setup streamlines the iterative annotation projects.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
%
After the first batch of documents (n=9) was annotated and the F1 measure IAA calculated, we saw some questions had zero agreement.
Our aim was to use the annotated corpus and resolve the conflicts between the annotators to increase the annotation agreement and also improve the instructions in the placards.
For multiple conflicting cases, the instructions were either unclear, interpreted differently, or the annotators forgot to annotate.
However, when the annotators went through the conflicts, they were able to resolve them.
Therefore, we recommend semi-automation for RoB information extraction given two succinct reasons.
Reason 1: Cognitive load of annotating (and assessment). Machine learning models can help function like ``hint finding'' for many questions.
Reason 2: Subjective judgments within the signalling questions.
